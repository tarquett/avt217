<p>This restaurant homepage has good designs. It has scrolling images going across in the first main box with the image kind of blurred out ane has text written on top of it. It also has a box underneath that you can click to view more items. They have their navigation bar up at the top with their logo in the middle of their bar. For the navigation bar if you hover over the words it will turn a different color and you can click on it to take you into the actual category.It is not included in the screenshot but I also enjoy the fact that when you scroll down it has yelp reviews and also has a map so you can see where the restaurant is.  </p>

<p>This restaurant homepage has a nice layout. It has a very simple font so that it won't distract you from everything else. They also chose nice fonts two in the first box. In the first box it is animated and has a nice video that plays to display the chef cooking, guests enjoying their time here and more. It also has some image drawing designs that add a lot to the website's personality. </p>

	<p><a href="https://www.republiquela.com/"> republique homepage</a> </p>

<p> This restaurant starts off with their company name in the top left hand corner and then the navigation bar to the right of it. It haS a nice outline for the nav bar and it has very simple font. Also what is interesting is that it includes events with a drop down arrow allowing you to see what events there are without having to click and redirect you. Then below it splits into cafe and bakery and then restaraunts allowing two options.

<p>This website starts off with the same design as the one above. The logo in the left hand corner followed by the nav bar which is center alligned. Then in the right hand corner it has a place for you to make reservations. The picture below this is also nice and high def. It allows you to scroll through to get a taste of what they have at their restaurant </p>
	
	<img src="img/petit.png" alt= "Screenshot of petit homepage" width="50%">
<p><a href="https://www.petittrois.com/"> petit homepage</a> </p>

<p>This website is different because it starts off with sort of a main menu where you can choose your location. The logo is at the top nicely alligned. The picture here takes up the whole screen and when choosing your location it has two buttons that are transparent then it takes you to another page. Once it takes you to another page, it has all the important information shown in the center with the nav bar up top center alligned. </p>
