	<h1>Website Critique</h1>
	<h2>Poorly Designed Websites</h2>

<p>This is the first website that I found to be a poorly designed website because it is very ugly the background images chosen are not neatly put. The text boxes have a gradient look to it and it does not look nice. It looks like a spam website. The side bar does not have nice style and is very plain. Nothing meshes well together and overall it is a poorly designed website. What I do like about this website is that it includes the art students at this school. </p>

<p>This website also looks like a spam website it has poor color choices and doesn’t draw in the user’s attention. It is very simplistic and lists the website name at the top of the screen. Overall it does not have the best layout. There is nothing that I liked about this website. </p>
	<h2>Well Designed Websites</h2>

<p>I believe this is a well-designed website because when you first arrive at the page since it is an Australlian website it can tell where you access this website from and it allows you to choose if if you want to visit the USA store or the AUS store. It also has tabs to surf the website and allows the website to be easily accessible. It also allows you to shop through their Instagram. It also has nice graphics which is a nice color tone. There is nothing that I do not like about this website other than when clicking on a photo, it takes you all the way back up to the top.

<p><a href="https://www.amazon.com/"> amazon homepage</a> </p>

<p>Amazon has a nice layout it organizes the website to allow you to see your past searches and items you might be interested in. It also has many categories and subcategories. It shows deals that are under $25. It also has boxes that allow you to see the images better and also allows it to pop more. The only thing that I do not enjoy about this website is that it can be overwhelming to look at the products. </p>
